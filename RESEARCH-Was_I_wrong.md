## Bloatware is malware
### 01 
Bloatware such as adware is wasting system resources to promote content

**Current conclusion:** If the program is not intended to be malicious it's not considered as malware, which is wrong considering **any** software as malicious if it's causing physicall harm to the system excluding author's intent should be considered malicious for reasons provided.
