# IMPROVEMENT(?):  take a look at dxvk / bobwya for extra ideas. btw, you should really use bobwya repo for wine as it comes with esync patches.
# Make automatic with interactive

# TODO: winetricks is annoying with GUI, sourcing them with ebuild might be more effective?

# IMPROVEMENT 
## afair pkg_postinstall is when you get outside sandbox but I suggest to avoid that and just creat script for users to run afterwards
## some of users may not have different wine directories and it may cause problems for them
## if you want to make your ebuild for many users respect that
