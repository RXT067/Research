is cool? Quantitative Type Theory?

`
We present Quantitative Type Theory, a Type Theory that records usage information for each variable in a judgement, based on a previous system by McBride. The usage information is used to give a realizability semantics using a variant of Linear Combinatory Algebras, refining the usual realizability semantics of Type Theory by accurately tracking resource behaviour. We define the semantics in terms of Quantitative Categories with Families, a novel extension of Categories with Families for modelling resource sensitive type theories.

Linear Combinatory Algebras?



### Rust
Is cool?... is cool!

Compiler faster then C++ in some scenarios, in thoery already faster?
- Needs testing

Redox OS is unix-like
- There is a problem with distribution of drivers since it's not popular like linux.
  - Solved by learning how to make a driver for it?

### C++
BOOORIIING

### ldris
eh?
