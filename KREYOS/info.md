## Abstract

Make a LFS/Redox-based OS that is supperior to gentoo with package manager supperior to portage and apt  combined

## TODO
TODO: Make a system for downstream compatibility<br>
TODO: Make P2P compilation<br>
TODO: USEFLAG-like feature<br>
TODO: Method to resolve conflicts with packages<br>

Do i want to greb rpm, etc.. that is used by apt?
- Fork OpenBuildSystem by OpenSUSE?

Language for terminal?
- BASH?
- FISH?
  - Supperior to bash?
- ZSH?
  - Supperior to FISH+BASH?

is cool? Quantitative Type Theory?

`
We present Quantitative Type Theory, a Type Theory that records usage information for each variable in a judgement, based on a previous system by McBride. The usage information is used to give a realizability semantics using a variant of Linear Combinatory Algebras, refining the usual realizability semantics of Type Theory by accurately tracking resource behaviour. We define the semantics in terms of Quantitative Categories with Families, a novel extension of Categories with Families for modelling resource sensitive type theories.

Linear Combinatory Algebras?



### Rust
Is cool?... is cool!

Compiler faster then C++ in some scenarios, in thoery already faster?
- Needs testing

Redox OS is unix-like
- There is a problem with distribution of drivers since it's not popular like linux.
  - Solved by learning how to make a driver for it?

### C++
BOOORIIING, but probably most effective

### ldris
eh?

`it's not amazing for building an OS right now since it requires GC` ???

`an option is to use Idris for generating C/ASM code from a well-typed DSL rather than Idris directly with it's runtime This should provide a hint as to how the codegen could be implemented along with the idris documentation on well-typed interpreters http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/monads_machine_code.html`

`Idris is currently a managed language so you'll get GC regardless though linear types may change that (I don't know which direction EB will go with it). If you want to play with GC less now there's always ATS but I suggest learning the basics of using dependent types in Idris before that.`
