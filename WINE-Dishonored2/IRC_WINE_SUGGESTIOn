<01> I know AMD a shader cache - used for Vulkan... But I don't have any AMD GPU's (too many bad experiences)... So I only know how to configure the Nvidia one.
<kreyren> Why is shader cache relevant?
<01> kreyren: For information about optimisation you might also want to wade through the dxvk issue tracker... https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues
<kreyren> Noted, can you provide more info about shader cache? meaning why is it relevant to the issue?
<01> There's all kinds of hacks linked to there, like frankin-modded proton builds, etc. :-)
<01> kreyren: With Vulkan a shader has to be generated, and this is typically done by dxvk worker threads on the fly. These shaders can be cached in the driver or dxvk (or both - but that is probably redundant)
<01> kreyren: You get stuttering when these shaders aren't ready in time for when they are needed. This is not an issue that affects DX11 to such a large extent.
<01> Any cached shaders you have can be reused on subsequent play throughs, with the same vulkan, dxvk and graphics driver versions.
<01> Nvidia recently took the stupid 128Mb cap off their shader cache. I haven't bothered to enable it. But basically I can just set it unlimited and point it at my tmp drive - if I needed to.
<01> You'll probably need to put more optimisation work in, to prop up a weaker graphics card.
